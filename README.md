This respiratory stores project for the course Research Module in Applied Microeconomics. The project is still in progress. It is also possible to view through _mybinder_. The project is connected to Travis to ensure the reproductivity.

Dataset used in the project is zipped as data.zip. auxilary.py stores function that is used. environment request is in env.yml.
